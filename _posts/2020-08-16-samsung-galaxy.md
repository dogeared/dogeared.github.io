## A Brief History of Phones and Headsets

In 2016, when the Apple [iPhone 7]() was released, I expressed my interest with a resounding: "meh." I had ever model of iPhone from the 3G up through the 6S. While the IP67 dust and water resistance rating was a first, I was personally over the platform. I would [jailbreak]() every model of iPhone I owned to squeeze the functionality out of it that I wanted and I wondered if Android had something to offer?

I got the [Nexus 6P]() from Google and it was glorious. I loved how configurable and flexible Android was. This phone was thin and fast. The back, center mounted fingerprint reader was easy to use. The generous 3450mAh battery beat out even the iPhone 7 Plus. I passed that phone on to my mom, who used it until it got stuck in [boot loop]() hell a year later.

From there, on the recommendation of a cousin, I got the [Samsung Galaxy 8](). I immediately fell in love with the curved edge screen, giving you more surface area while keeping the phone from being too wide. The "bloatware" that people often complain about with Samsung didn't bother me. Although, I moved most of the custom Samsung apps into a "parked" folder and used the stock Google apps wherever possible. Such is the joy of Android! 

Since then, I've had the Galaxy 9+, S10+ and now, the Note 10+.

I've tried so many different bluetooth headsets over the years, I've lost track. Apple airpods offered features that no other competitor had. Most notably, the ability to use the left and right interchangeably was a real game changer. At the time of the release of the first airpods, I was using the Jabra Elite Sport (original). While these were truly wireless and sounded great, your only choices were right-side only, or both in. you couldn't use the left independently. And, it had click-style buttons which were challenging to use. I bought and ended up returning the airpods as they really did not play well with Android.

Since then, I tried and returned the Samsung IconX. They were a good effort, but not quite there. With the release of the Galaxy Buds, Samsung had a real competitor on the market. With great sound, touch surfaces and total interchangeability between right and left, it was finally a worthy competitor to Airpods.

Galaxy Buds+ added a killer feature (for my use case): top-tap to change volume. This is a "labs" feature but one that finally made the Galaxy Buds usable with devices like my Amazon FireTV Stick. Prior to this feature, gut Buds were unusable outside of mobile phones and tablet devices as they didn't have their own volume driver. So, if you made the mistake of trying to use your Buds with a FireTV, you'd get blasted in the ears with full volume and no way to control it. The top-tap feature has an amusing and perhaps unintended use-case. You can tap the top of your right ear to raise volume and the top of your left ear to lower volume!

## Samsung on the Bleeding Edge

The Galaxy Note 10+ and the Galaxy Buds+ have been the killer pairing for me. The under-the-glass fingerprint reader is topnotch and fast. The screen is big, while not being too big. It's easy to switch the Buds+ to other devices and it works equally well with my Apple laptop and iPad as it does with my Android and FireTV devices.

While I've stayed on the leading edge, Samsung has been willing to push the envelope with its Fold series. I wasn't personally interested in the Z Fold as it seemed like it would be too thick and cumbersome as an everday phone for me. But, the Z Flip had me very intrigued. Aside from the nostalgia factor of a flip phone, it looked very sturdy and usable. when the 5G version dropped with an updated processor and updated hinge, I thought it was time for a try.

At the same time I was considering the Z Flip 5G, Samsung dropped the long speculated about Beans bluetooth headset. Samsung officially calls it the Galaxy Buds Live. Beans is a much better and more accurate name and I will never call them anything else. With a truly unique form factor and promised all-day comfort, I had to give them a try.

The Z Flip was a revelation is usability. It's a perfect fit folded in a pocket and then a generous modern large screen when open.
